# BLACKJACK GAME

# THE BASIC RULES WHEN PLAYING BLACKJACK:

1. The goal of blackjack is to beat the dealer's hand without going over 21.
2. Face cards are worth 10. Aces are worth 1 or 11, whichever makes a better hand.
3. Each player starts with two cards, one of the dealer's cards is hidden until the end.
4. To 'Hit' is to ask for another card. To 'Stand' is to hold your total and end your turn.
5. If you go over 21 you bust, and the dealer wins regardless of the dealer's hand.
6. If you are dealt 21 from the start (Ace & 10), you got a blackjack.
7. Blackjack usually means you win 1.5 the amount of your bet. Depends on the casino.
8. Dealer will hit until his/her cards total 15 or higher.
9. The dealer acts last and must hit on 16 or less and stand on 17 through 21.
10. Players win when their hand totals higher than dealerâ€™s hand, or they have 21 or less when the dealer busts (i.e., exceeds 21).

# BLACKJACK CARD VALUES

All cards count their face value in blackjack.
Picture cards count as 10 and the ace can count as either 1 or 11.
Card suits have no meaning in blackjack.
The total of any hand is the sum of the card values in the hand. A hand containing a 4-5-8 totals 17. Another containing a queen-5 totals 15.
It is always assumed that the ace counts as 11 unless so doing would make your hand total exceed 21, in which case the ace reverts to a value of 1.

# Hit:
If you hit, you take another card or cards in hopes of getting closer to 21. If the player's total exceeds 21 after hitting, the player is said to "bust" and loses the bet. In shoe games, the player signals a hit by pointing to his cards or scratching or waving toward himself. In facedown games, the player signals a hit by scratching the table with the cards. Verbal calls to hit are not accepted -- signals are used for the benefit of the security cameras above the table, so a taped record is on hand to settle any potential disputes.

# Stand: 
If you stand, you elect to draw no more cards in hopes that the current total will beat the dealer. Signal a stand by holding a flattened palm over your cards in a faceup game or by sliding your cards under your bet in a facedown game.
